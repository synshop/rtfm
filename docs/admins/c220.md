# c220 and LXD

This was a 1U server the shop used to host its LAN infra on.  It has been retired.  See [Proxmox](/admins/proxmox/) for all this stuff now.

Old info on how c220 was setup is in [mrjones' blog post](https://blog.plip.com/2017/09/24/from-zero-to-lxd-installing-a-private-compute-cloud-on-a-cisco-c220-m4sff/)
