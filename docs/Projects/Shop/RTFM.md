# RTFM Rework
RTFM is the documentation for the SYN Shop.
It is currently being reworked in many areas described below.

## Equipment List
The main equipment list will be summarized, and detailed lists will be provided for each department.
## Equipment
Equipment pages are being standardized to provide more regular and accessible information for shop members.
Ideally people should be able to read an equipment article and understand how it works and why they would use the equipment.
## Projects
Projects are being reworked into two categories below:

### Individual Projects
These pages will be for common projects that people may want to do in the shop.
These projects may require multiple pieces of equipment, or may be higher in complexity.
There maybe projects written for specific groups.

### Shop Projects
Shop projects are group projects that improve the shop, or involve multiple members in some manner.
They will be put into active and inactive status as people participate or move on from projects.

## Manual of Style
A consistent style is being standardized across RTFM.
