# Shapeoko PCB Milling

Pawel, Brian and possily Tyson are working on getting the Shapeoko into shape for milling PCB's. In ghe

Current list of tasks that need doing toward this end:

* Replace waste board with something better - possible finer MDF?
* Level the surface - waiting on 1/4" collet adapter so we can use a bigger bit (Pawel ordered it)
* Test milling on copper clad with v-bits
* [Build enclosure](http://www.cnccookbook.com/img/MillStuff/IHMillStand/ExtrusionEnclosure.jpg)
* [Upgrade spindle - we are looking at a Wolfganh 650](http://www.ebay.com/itm/1-8-TB-650-CNC-Router-Spindle-Sherline-Taig-K2-Zenbot-Wolfgang-Engineering-/171216814635?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&hash=item27dd51422b) 


Currently using the following software for our workflow

Progress:

2014-02-17 - Brian and Pawel rebuilt the enclosure and fixed rhe exhaust fans. Tried running an H-Bridge PCB milling job on MDF with a drywall cutout bit. Results are about what you'd expect.
