# FAQ

## What is SYN Shop?

SYN Shop is a [hackerspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) located in Henderson, Nevada. It is a space 
for sharing, creation, collaboration, research, development, mentoring, and of course, 
learning. Our motto is: "Let's make stuff awesome!"

The group tends to be focused on electronics. However, many members do metal working, 
programming, wood working, crafting, and a variety of other things. Synshop provides a 
fertile environment and community that is passionate about learning, helping others, 
and growing the community of hackers/makers/tinkerers/geeks in Las Vegas. We also like 
to meet people from other hackerspaces, and have seen people visit SYN Shop from 
hackerspaces world wide.

## What is the best time to visit SYN Shop?

Note - we're operating at reduced capacity - see our [COVID19 page](https://synshop.org/covid-19-status).

When not operating at reduced capacity, our hours normally are:

* Monday: 6pm - 10pm DIY Robot Domination
* Tuesday:  6pm - 10pm  Craft night, Community night
* Wednesday: 6pm - 10pm 
* Thursday 6pm - 10pm
* Friday 6pm - 10pm
* Saturday: 3pm - 10pm
* Sunday: Closed 

Mondays and Tuesdays are themed after interest groups. If you come to work, your project 
does not have to match the theme. However these nights tend to attract members of the community 
that are interested in that theme. DIY Robot Domination attracts robotics enthusiasts. Craft Night
 attracts "Team Low Tech" and all others who are interested in a variety of general crafts. Think 
 of a knitting circle where one person knits, one person builds models, and another sews a quilt.

You do not need to be a member to come spend time and acclimate yourself. You do need to be a member to use our equipment.

## What are the rules?

We are a community, which means there are more people here than just you. If you get value from being with
us, please give back with time or a donation. To expand on our most basic rule, "Don’t be a jerk" we
have come up with the [following rules (PDF)](./SYN Shop Rules v3 2020-08-12.pdf) for members
to follow while at SYN Shop. 

Further, SYN Shop has our own bylaws that start out: "SYN Shop is dedicated to the goal of educating and enabling
 the greater Las Vegas community in the creative use of developing and established fabrication technologies, and to
  undertake and pursue any lawful activity associated with such technologies."
  
We regularly review the bylaws and the current copy is [available for all to read (PDF)](./SYN Shop Bylaws - 2022-06-01.pdf).
