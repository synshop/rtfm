# FAQ

## What is SYN Shop?

SYN Shop is a [hackerspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) located in Las Vegas, Nevada. It is a space 
for sharing, creation, collaboration, research, development, mentoring, and of course, 
learning. Our motto is: "Let's make stuff awesome!"

The group tends to be focused on electronics. However, many members do metal working, 
programming, wood working, crafting, and a variety of other things. Synshop provides a 
fertile environment and community that is passionate about learning, helping others, 
and growing the community of hackers/makers/tinkerers/geeks in Las Vegas. We also like 
to meet people from other hackerspaces, and have seen people visit SYN Shop from 
hackerspaces world wide.

## What is the best time to visit SYN Shop?

SYNShop is held open by volunteers, so we are usually there in the evenings outside of our day jobs. Currently,
the shop is held during the following hours: 

* Monday: 7pm - 10pm 
* Tuesday:  7pm - 10pm  Craft night, Cybersecurity Office Hours community night (alternating)
* Wednesday: 7pm - 10pm   DC702 Meetup (Last Wednesday of the month)
* Thursday: 6pm - 10pm
* Friday: 6:30pm - 10pm 
* Saturday: Noon - 5pm   Sumo Robot fighting (Second Saturday of the month)  
* Sunday: Closed 

Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays are sometimes themed after interest groups. If you come to work, your project 
does not have to match the theme. However these nights tend to attract members of the community 
that are interested in that theme. Sumo Robot fighting attracts autonomous robotics enthusiasts. Craft Night
 attracts "Team Low Tech" and all others who are interested in a variety of general crafts. Think 
 of a knitting circle where one person knits, one person builds models, and another sews a quilt. Cybersecurity Office Hours 
 attracts people interested in Cybersecurity DC702 is our local Defcon enthusiasts group. 

You do not need to be a member to come spend time and acclimate yourself. You do need to be a member to use our equipment.
