# Local Resources

The following are local Las Vegas vendors which are good resources for finding things locally:

## Plastics:

### [Sabic Polymershapes](http://www.sabicpolymershapes.com/)
[6435 South Valley View Blvd., Suite A  
Las Vegas, NV 89118](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=6435+South+Valley+View+Blvd.,+Suite+A&hl=en&sll=36.083511,-115.180664&sspn=0.116672,0.12085&t=h&z=17)  
Tel: 702-732-8866  
Located in the NW corner of South Valley View Blvd. and Sunset Rd.  
This is a distributor only and doesn't have scraps.

### [Piper Plastics](http://www.pplastics1.com/)
[7260 Dean Martin Drive  
Suite 1000  
Las Vegas, Nevada 89118](http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&biw=1363&bih=746&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=piper+plastic+las+vegas+nv&fb=1&gl=us&hq=piper+plastic&hnear=0x80beb782a4f57dd1:0x3accd5e6d5b379a3,Las+Vegas,+NV&cid=0,0,251644501515819261&ei=FDtRT_TDDdLCgAekirXRDQ&sa=X&oi=local_result&ct=image&sqi=2&ved=0CBUQ_BI)  
Tel: 702-269-8076  
Located at the NE corner of Dean Martin and Warm Springs  
They will sell scrap pieces for small projects or order full sheets. Very knowledgeable.  
Their selection of 'standard' pieces is decent and so is their price of $1 a pound for less than 1/2" thick pices and $2 a pound for 1/2" thick pieces or thicker.  They seem to have a few pieces here and there that aren't standard, so it might be worth pawing through their bin a bit.

### [Plastic Man](https://plasticmaninc.com/)
[3823 Renate Dr.  
Las Vegas, Nevada 89103](https://www.google.com/maps/dir//36.1257189,-115.1907725/@36.125719,-115.190772,16z?hl=en-US)  
Tel: 702-362-2113  
Located just south of Spring Mountain Rd on Valley View Blvd in what appears to be an alley, but it has a labeled road name.  
A little hard to find and little to no parking area.  They don't sell scraps, since they use a recycling service.

### [Welch Plastics](https://welchplastics.com/)
[4080 W Desert Inn Rd Suite W110  
Las Vegas, NV 89102](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Welch+Plastics+%7C+Custom+Fabrication+%7C+Raffle+Drums+Las+Vegas/@36.1306312,-115.1960816,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c8c6a8ce60a431:0xb6daa13c4c7de039!8m2!3d36.1306312!4d-115.1938929)  
Tel: 702-240-9668  
Located right on W Desert Inn Rd, with the door facing the road.  
They have some scrap and willing sell small pieces of what they have as 'leftovers', but it's not cheap.  I got 1/2" thick pieces for $18.something per sq. ft.

### [Laird Plastics](https://www.lairdplastics.com/)
[6485 W Sunset Rd Suite 101  
Las Vegas, NV 89118](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Laird+Plastics+Inc/@36.070858,-115.2346717,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c8cf8055442b01:0x45f8d30071eda1e7!8m2!3d36.070858!4d-115.232483)  
Tel: 702-220-3761  
Just south of Sunset Rd, and not easily visible when coming from the east.  
They use a recycle service, but seemed like they would let me look through their bin, if it hadn't been emptied earlier that day.
