### Specifications
#### Paper Supported
##### Rolls
3" core
##### Manual Feeder

## Usage

### Setup
 We only support a single configured roll of Plain Paper of ideally 45lb,
 though if that is out of stock we may choose to load something higher quality. 
 You are allowed to bring in your own roll material, but must be familiar with how the roll holder operates and how to load the paper, please ask in the Discord if you'd like to learn. 
 If you do bring your own materials, the printer *must* be returned to its default configuration and paper after your job is complete.
### Changing the Roll

## Maintenance
It should remain on at all times to prevent ink waste from nozzle flushing.
