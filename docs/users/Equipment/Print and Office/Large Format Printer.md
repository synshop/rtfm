# Canon iPF6400SE Large Format Printer

The Large Format Printer is located in the Print room, and can print up to a width of 24" in full color. It should remain on at all times to prevent ink waste from nozzle flushing.

See [Canon's site](https://www.usa.canon.com/support/p/imageprograf-ipf6400) for more info.

# Setup

Currently, the printer is not available on the network so a computer must connect directly via USB and have [the drivers installed](https://www.usa.canon.com/support/p/imageprograf-ipf6400).  We only support a single configured roll of Plain Paper of ideally 45lb, though if that is out of stock we may choose to load something higher quality.  You are allowed to bring in your own roll material, but must be familiar with how the roll holder operates and how to load the paper, please ask in the Discord if you'd like to learn. If you do bring your own materials, the printer *must* be returned to its default configuration and paper after your job is complete.  To date, no one has yet tried to load manual feed paper, though it theoretically is capable of it.

# Cost

Materials cost are currently:

* $0.50/ft of paper
* $0.70/ml of ink

Cash in the donation box is fine or use the online [payment form](https://synshop.org/payment) and note it's for a Large Format Printer job.

To measure usage, use the Job Menu on the printer to get the Paper Length and Ink Total for each print job. See [this video](Canon.iPF6400SE.usage.howto.mp4) which shows how to access these menus.
