# Mailing Lists

Hello and welcome, we are glad you are interested in keeping in touch as we define and build out the space.

If you’d be so kind, please take a moment to fill out [this quick survey](http://goo.gl/OjRty). it help give us a better idea about the direction people would like to take the hackerspace.

Just a little heads up about the mailing lists. The [announcement list](http://groups.google.com/group/synshop-announce) is a very low traffic, moderated list so communications will be pretty one sided.

If you’d like to join the more active mailing list, please feel free to join the SYN Shop [regular mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/synshop).

While the mailing lists still exist, they are not very active. Most people have moved to using the [SYN Shop Discord](https://synshop.org/discord).

Feel free to email the either list if you have any questions.
