### Maintenance Log
**2023-11-29 - Rebuilt Power Switch Key assembly** - Nuke Mike

- Discovered one leg of the power circuit was loose
- Discovered one side of the dual switch was broken
- Reconnected circuit
- Switched key switch to the other side of the switch assembly, which is new/untouched.
- Reassembled switch assembly in laser cutter
- Still no go; but key was tested to work correctly. Issue has now been traced to the ground-fault box.


**2023-11-29 - Blown fuse replaced** - Nuke Mike

- Digging further down the power train, found a fuse that was blown.
- The power plug had a spare fuse, so we replaced with that. 
- Big Boi now up and running. NukeMike will pick up a replacement fuse tomorrow and put it back into the spare fuse spot.
