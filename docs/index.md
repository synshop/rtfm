# SYN Shop Docs

**Apr 2022 Update: We're finishin up the [new shop on Harrison Dr in Las Vegas](https://synshop.org/location) after [moving from American Pacific in Henderson](/users/SYNShop3.0/FAQ/)! Join our [Discord server](https://synshop.org/discord) for latest info.**

This site houses documentation about everything and anything at the SYN Shop.  Some highlights you might 
be interested in are:

* [Equipment list](/users/SYN Shop Tool List/)
* [FAQ](/users/FAQ/)
* [SYN Shop Logos](/users/Logos/)

Otherwise, these documents are broken into two main parts: 

*  **Users:**  - These docs are for folks using the tools and software .
*  **Admins:**  - These docs are for shop members building and maintaining tools and software at the the shop.

To read the docs, choose an option from the menu above.

You're welcome to read anything here, but note which section you're in!
