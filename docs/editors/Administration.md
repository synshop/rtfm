# rtfm administration

rtfm site is built with [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).  

For systems administration content that used to be in this section, please see [google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17BsZgndsAvruVEW8TnPwmr_dyF2HlpQ7IftDi_4iuFE/edit).

## Content changes

* [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the [rtfm](https://github.com/synshop/rtfm) repo to your user on github
* Go to your copy of the repo (eg https://github/USERNAME/rtfm) and clone it
* if you haven't already, install [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/#installation) on your local machine.
* create a branch, make your edits
* run "mkdocs build" and verify that the changes look good locally.
* commit your changes them and push the branch up to your github rtfm repo
* create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) for your branch against master on the main [rtfm](https://github.com/synshop/rtfm) repo

A SYN Shop member will review and merge your request if it all looks good!

## How content is pushed live

There are two repos to house content.  One repo, [rtfm](https://github.com/synshop/rtfm) houses the raw, unprocessed markdown files. Another repo [rtfm-generated](https://github.com/synshop/rtfm-generated) hosts the processed files that mkdocs generates.  Every time a commit is merged to the `master` branch in `rtfm` the following happens:

1. A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) is fired based off of [the ci.yml file](https://github.com/synshop/rtfm/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml). All actions are executed in VMs called runners.  GitHub gives a certain amount of runner hours for free to non-profits.
2. Following the `ci.yml` file, the runner  checks out `master branch`, installs `mkdocs` and generates the HTML for the site in the runner's VM. The site is checked out using a robot account (`monitoring-synshop-bot`) that only has access to push to `rtfm-generated`
3. The runner then pushes the site from `rtfm` repo to the `rtfm-generated` repo. This is destructive, so any pages not on `rtfm` will be deleted. 
4. The [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for `rtfm-generated` are configured so that the contents of the repo are served up under `rtfm.synshop.org`
5. `rtfm.synshop.org` is a CNAME for `synshop.github.io` which is set at an org level to show the contents of `rtfm-generated`

## How to regenerate the token to push the site live

The robot account (`monitoring-synshop-bot`) needs to regenerate the personal access token every 90 days. We set it to expire in 90 days so we remember how to regenerate it - if we set it for a year we'll never remember.  These are the steps:

1. get a copy of the SYN Shop Systems password safe
2. using the credentials in that safe for `monitoring-synshop-bot`, log into https://github.com
3. Go to the accounts [token page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new).  And click the name of token that start with "rtfm".
4. Then click the button "Regenerate token" Set it to expire in 90 days. **Be sure to copy the token - it will only be shown once!!**
5. Log out of that account, and log into an account that is in [the SYN Shop org](https://github.com/orgs/synshop/people)
6. Find the `DEPOLY_TO_RTFM_SITE` on the [Actions secrets page](https://github.com/organizations/synshop/settings/secrets/actions) and  click the pencel to edit the value
7. Where it says "Secret values are encrypted and cannot be displayed, but you can **enter a new value**" - click the link to enter a new value.
8. paste in the value from step 3 above and save
